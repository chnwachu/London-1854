        <p>(done in order from top to bottom)</p>
        <h2 >Research</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 20px">To start I first read the material necessary in "An Introduction to Designing with D3" by Scott Murray to understand what is possible within d3.
          <br>
          Then I looked at the requirements for this assignment to see what I needed to be add. Once done I decided to start with the map since I consider it to be the most important visual tool for the project.
        <h2>street map</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 20px"> I orginally started using d3.lines to make the streets but realized after sometime paths was a much better option.
          <br>Added labels for street after drawing method was complete.
          <h2>Timeline bar chart</h2>
           
          <p style="font-size: 20px"> Next I made a Timeline bar chart because it would compliment the map.
          <h2>deathdisplay</h2>
          <p style="font-size: 20px"> I added a deathdisplay on hover for each bar after creating the graph.
          <h2>pumps</h2>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">Once that was made I added in the pumps location to the map so I would have a clear refrence pointplotting to add the deaths.<br>
          
          
          To make sure they were plotted properly I googled the map of 1854 cholera.
          I looked back at the files I downloaded to understand the format d3 would best respond to when plotting the dots.
          <h2>Male and Female death points</h2>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">Now having a better understanding of the map I started to add male and female death points. Adding age group number reference color code after.
            <br>
          all colors chosen were made with colorblindness in mine. Meaning they should have a high enough contrast that anyone can see the differnce between them.
          <h2>interactivity</h2>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">Once the male and female death points were properly displaying I used svg #mapdeaths to introduce interactivity. <br>
          Basically stating anytime 
          a bar inside the timeline graph was hoveredover, delete all circles on the map. Then I added in the circle for each death matching the bar death and age range.
          <h2>Agedisplay</h2>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">I also added a hoverover display age range feature after so the users could better understand the dots being plotted.
          <h2>Legend</h2>  
          <p style="font-size: 20px">For good note I also added a legend key to the left so users understand what each dot represents.
          <h2>Age group bar chart</h2> 
          <p style="font-size: 20px">I added another bar chart at the side displaying deaths by age groups. Added female and male disniction colors and legend afterwords.
          <h2>Male and Female ratio display</h2> 
          <p style="font-size: 20px">This was added so the users would have an exact understanding of how much of each sex died in the age group.
          <h2>Scatterplot</h2> 
          <p style="font-size: 20px">Lastly, I added a scatterplot to see if there was any correlation between age groups and the amount of deaths that took place.
          
        </p>
      

  
  <h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">Design Decisions</h1>
  <h2>Overall</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 20px">I wanted my design to be simple and straight forward. <br>I wanted users to immediately notice the map and bar graph so I made those the biggest.
          The side charts were made for a more detailed understanding and are not as important. That is why they are on the side.
          
        <h2>street map</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 20px"> 
          Made the street and labels black so it would not contrast with the male and female dots being placed on it. 
          <h2>Timeline bar chart</h2>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">The reason I choose a bar chart for deaths by date was because I thought it would be the easist way to decipher where the data stands relative to the date.
          
          <h2>deathdisplay</h2>
          <p style="font-size: 20px"> I added a deathdisplay on hover for each bar after creating the graph. Made so users after exact understanding of how many people died on that day.
          <h2>pumps</h2>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">Made them larger then the rest of the circles so that they would easily noticable. Also so users can see if pump proximity increased likelyness of death<br>
          
         
          <h2>Male and Female death points</h2>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">I choose to use purple and blue for my genders but made sure to look up colorblind contrasting colors so colorblindness would not be an issue.
          <h2>interactivity</h2>
          <p style="font-size: 20px"> I used hoverover for interactivity between almost all the charts so that users would immedately get the details their looking for without possibly not noticing the details boxfeature.
          Basically stating anytime <br> I made this bar dark pink so it contrasted all backgrounds it displayed on noticably.
          
          <h2>Agedisplay</h2>
          <p style="font-size: 20px">I gave the hover a background color on the map because it was hard to make out text without one. Also disappearing 
            
          <h2>Legend</h2>  
          <p style="font-size: 20px">The legend was placed right next the map so that users can have a easily noticable reference point when observing the map and its changes.
          <h2>Age group bar chart</h2> 
          <p style="font-size: 20px">The reason I choose a bar chart for death by age groups was because I thought it would be the easist way to decipher where the data stands relative to the date or age. 
          <h2>Male and Female ratio display</h2> 
          <p style="font-size: 20px">This was added to users would have a better understanding of how much of each sex died in the age group.
          <h2>Scatterplot</h2> 
          <p style="font-size: 20px"> Choose blue as the default color so users assume it relates to the time graph because the bars are the same color highlighted.

  <h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">Findings</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>Correlation between Age groups and deaths</h2>
  <img src="agegroups.JPG" alt="Agegroups">
  <p style="font-size: 20px">After viewing the age groups charts, 
    It seems young children (0-10) and the elderly(>80) were most susceptible to the illness. 
    <br>This is possibly due to weak immune systems young children and the ederly have compared to teen and middle aged people. </p>

  <h2>Cases seem to spike around the beginning of September</h2>
  <br>
  <img src="deathdates.JPG" alt="Deaths by date">
  <p style="font-size: 20px">Cases a very slow to start in mid August but as the beginning of September approches.<br>
  Espically on Aug 31 where the cases increased by seven times the previous day.
  <br> Not sure exactly why this happpened. Possibly could of been large social gathering where multiple people drank from the same contaminated pump.
  <h2>Illness seem to center around Broad Street</h2>
  <br>
  <img src="mapdeaths.JPG" alt="Map of deaths taken place over a month on Broad Street">
  <p style="font-size: 20px">Looking at all the deaths over the past couple weeks, the number of deaths seem to rise the closer you get to Broad Street.
    <br>
    This is possibly due to the pump at the center of the street. <br>
    This pump could be the most contaminated of all, making the illness easily transferable compared to the rest of the pumps in the area.
